# Global-Electricity-Access-and-Production-Analysis-Dashboard
A Power BI analysis of global energy trends from 2005 to 2023. The dashboard tracks the percentage of the world's population with access to electricity and visualizes the shift in energy sources (coal, gas, oil vs. renewables, nuclear). 

The analysis focuses on two main areas:

1) Global Access: Tracking the percentage of the population in all countries that gained access to electricity over time.

2) Production Mix: Showing the shift in electricity generation sources, comparing fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) against cleaner alternatives (renewable, hydro, nuclear).

The final interactive dashboard lets users quickly compare countries, see how energy production is changing, and identify which nations are successfully expanding electricity access.
